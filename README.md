# dotfiles
These dotfiles are for my current Arch Linux installation on my ThinkPad T550. I am using [i3-gaps](https://github.com/csxr/i3-gnome) in combination with a GNOME session (follow the guide [here](https://github.com/csxr/i3-gnome). This allows me to configure things like wifi, bluetooth and my touchpad with minimal configuration.

I manage my dotfiles with [dotfiles](https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles).

I use [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) as my status bar. By defining signals in the config and using custom scripts that send signals whenever the volume or brightness is changed, the bar can update instantly.

For music, I use [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org) with [ncmpcpp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ncmpcpp) as the frontend.

For my mail, I use neomutt. You can find an excellent wizard [here](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard).
